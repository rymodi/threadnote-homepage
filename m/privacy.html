									<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
									<p>It is Threadnote’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website and application.</p>

									<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

									<p>Like most website operators, Threadnote collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Threadnote’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Threadnote’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Threadnote may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

									<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

									<p>Certain visitors to Threadnote’s websites choose to interact with Threadnote in ways that require Threadnote to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Threadnote gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our mailing list to provide an email address. In all cases, Threadnote collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Threadnote. Threadnote does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

									<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>

									<p>Threadnote may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For instance, Threadnote may monitor where visitors click first when they visit threadnote.com. Threadnote may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Threadnote does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

									<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>

									<p>Threadnote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Threadnote’s behalf or to provide services available at Threadnote’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Threadnote’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Threadnote will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Threadnote discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Threadnote believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Threadnote, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Threadnote website and have supplied your email address, Threadnote may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Threadnote and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Threadnote takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

									<h4>Cookies</h4>

									<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Threadnote reserves the right to use cookies to help Threadnote identify and track visitors, their usage of Threadnote website, and their website access preferences. Threadnote visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Threadnote’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Threadnote’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

									<h4>Business Transfers</h4>

									<p>If Threadnote, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Threadnote goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Threadnote may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
									</p>

									<h4>Ads</h4>

									<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Threadnote and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

									<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>

									<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Threadnote may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Threadnote’s sole discretion. Threadnote encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
